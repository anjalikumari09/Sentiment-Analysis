**=====Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP)=====**

This project focuses on building a Sentiment Analysis system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify textual data into Positive, Negative sentiments. The system analyzes user-generated content such as reviews or comments to extract meaningful insights and understand overall sentiment trends.

**Objectives**

Preprocess and clean raw text data for analysis
Perform sentiment classification using NLP and machine learning techniques
Analyze and visualize sentiment distribution
Build a beginner-friendly, easy-to-understand end-to-end ML pipeline

**Tech Stack**

**Programming Language:** Python

**Libraries & Tools:**

NLTK
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib / Seaborn

**Workflow**

Data collection and loading
Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
Feature extraction using Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF
Model training and testing
Sentiment prediction and performance evaluation

**Model Used**

Naive Bayes
Logistic Regression
(Model selection depends on implementation and performance)

**Evaluation Metrics**

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score

**Outcome**

Successfully classifies text into sentiment categories

Helps in understanding public opinion and feedback trends

Demonstrates the practical application of NLP techniques in real-world scenarios
